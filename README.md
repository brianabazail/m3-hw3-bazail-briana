A couple issues I encountered as I was working on this assignment:

- I could not figure out how to apply the opacity to just the background image without it applying to the logo and button in the header. 
- I had issues filling the bottom section with the background color. 
- I am still unable to push my commits to the Git repo. I attached the error it gave me.
